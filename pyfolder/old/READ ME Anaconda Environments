in a new terminal, OSX will have python 2.7.10 active

**to set up anaconda environment with 2.7.12 resources:
source activate py27 #can also deactivate

**to set up anaconda environment with 3.5.2 resources:
source activate root #can also deactivate

**to get current active environment for a specific terminal session:
conda info --envs

**To update the correct environment, first activate the environment, then do
conda update --all

**NOTE: anaconda resources by default are those pretaining to anaconda3, including ipython 3.5
if no env is set. However if nothing from anaconda is used, the system's default python is active 2.7.10
